# Mechanism via FindLIB.cmake
# ==============================
# Boost:
# -------
# Windows: Download the pre-built binaries from http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/ for VS2013 (msvc-12 64bit).
# Set the windows PATH variable to "<YOUR_BOOST_DIRECTORY>\lib64-msvc-12.0" and CMake will find it.
# Linux: Boost can usually be installed via a package manager (e.g. apt-get install boost-all-dev) and this variable can be left uncommented.
#set(BOOST_ROOT "/home/user/boost/install" CACHE PATH "Boost search location" FORCE)

# Mechanism via ConfigLIB.cmake in 3rd party library directory
# ==============================
# OpenCV:
# -------
# Windows: Download the package from opencv.org, use 2.4.7.2 or never. It includes binaries for VS2013. Set this path accordingly.
#set(OpenCV_DIR "C:\\opencv\\install" CACHE PATH "Location of OpenCVConfig.cmake" FORCE)
# Linux: Usually can be left blank but it can be used if OpenCV is not found.
#set(OpenCV_DIR "/home/user/opencv/install/share/OpenCV" CACHE PATH "Location of OpenCVConfig.cmake" FORCE)

# Configuration options
# ==============================
set(BUILD_EXAMPLES ON CACHE BOOL "Build the example applications." FORCE)
set(BUILD_DOCUMENTATION OFF CACHE BOOL "Build the library documentation." FORCE)
